Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Teodora and I am currently studying at UCL taking BSc Computer Science.

I love coding and any sort of puzzle that will get my brain working.
Most of my experience is in Java, but I have worked with Python, C and HTML before. I am currently studing to become more comfortable with these languages.

ðŸ‘¯I would love to join a community of people that are also looking to exmand their knowledge in computer science and challenge themselves.
